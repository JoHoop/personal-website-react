-   bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
-   styled with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

Kudos to [Cody Bennett](https://github.com/CodyJasonBennett), [José Coelho](https://github.com/jcoelho93) and [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7) for the inspiration.

## Features

-   All of the personal information is populated from the resume.json file following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. Discover the official schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
-   The toggle/switch for the dark mode syncs its state to the local storage.

#### Coming soon

-   Two beautiful resume page templates generated based on the data in the resume.json file -- a modern approach of the traditional printed CV.
-   Rich Google search results using structured data with [json-ld.org/](https://json-ld.org/).

## Customization

Feel free to fork this project and customize it with your own information and style.

Refer to the [Material UI docs](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) for guidance on how to quickly customize the themes, components and colors to suit your tastes.

If you improve the app in any way a pull request would be very much appreciated ✌️
